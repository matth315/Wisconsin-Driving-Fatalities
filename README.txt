Shiny App for Wisconsin Traffic Fatalities:

1) This app displays a map of Wisconsin colored by the number of traffic fatalities in each county. Click on a county to see the number of deaths. This display was made using the "tmap" package.

2) The bar in the upper right enables the user to select a county to filter by.

3) On the right side, there are four bar plots about time of day, day of week, type of crash, and type of road. These plots can display data for a single county or the entire state.
